# BeYoutiful-Body-Shaming-Tweet-Analysis
BeYoutiful can be used to detect and segregate tweets representing body shaming in any form.

Social media platforms like Twitter expose people to certain "beauty standards" thereby propelling them towards what is termed as being "picture perfect" or "beautiful" in a vague sense. Research shows that such toxic behaviour contributes to body dysmorphic disorders or BDD and eating disorders in victims of cyber bullying. Studies have reported rates of BDD of 7% and 15% in patients approaching cosmetic surgery to enhance their physical appearance and a rate of 12% in patients seeking dermatologic treatment to contour and abolish the aspects of body shaming. 
In order to counter this problem, I decided to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets on the basis of their sentiment as positive(not bodyshaming),negative(bodyshaming) or neutral. This could be deployed as an app in the future that could make social media "socially fit" to be used by all,irrespective of their body type or physcial features.
This would help people to segregate unwanted tweets beforehand so that they may have a smooth experience without any hinderance from ridiculous elements.
